# Advanced Python Libraries Examples

This repository contains examples and demonstrations of advanced Python libraries commonly used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Libraries Covered

- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing
  - Array operations
  - Linear algebra
  - Statistical functions
  - Broadcasting
  - Matrix manipulations

## Code Examples

### NumPy Examples
- `numpy1.py`: Basic NumPy operations and concepts
- `numpy2.py`: Advanced array operations (stacking, splitting, ufuncs)
- `numpy3.py`: Advanced linear algebra operations (eigenvalues, SVD)
- `numpy4.py`: Advanced statistical operations
- `numpy5.py`: Advanced broadcasting and matrix manipulations

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical guide and reference for working with advanced Python libraries. Each example is thoroughly commented to explain the concepts and usage patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Additional libraries will be added as more examples are included.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install numpy`
3. Run the examples: `python numpy1.py`
